Salt receipts are grouped depending on system initialization state to simplify
testing with docker (i.e. be able to reuse docker cache).

* mirrorcache-0*.sls - basic installation which don't rely on external 
  dependencies;
* mirrorcache-1*.sls - states which require database up and running;
* mirrorcache-2*.sls - states which require systemd up and running 
  (i.e. will not be cached in Dockerfile).

To build test docker image and start test container run `dist/salt/test/start-container.sh`
The app will be available on ports: 
* 80 - haproxy
* 3000 - Mirrorcache app

To log into the container run `docker exec -it mirrorcachesalted bash`.
To stop the container run `docker stop -t0 mirrorcachesalted`.
The container is started with --rm flag, so it will be erased automatically
once stopped.
To remove the image `docker stop -t0 mirrorcachesalted`.
